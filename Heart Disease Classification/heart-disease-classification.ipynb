    "# Heart Disease Binary Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the heart disease of an individual based on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following approach is to be taken:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modelling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can the model correctly predict whether or not they have heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "> Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/heart-disease-prediction?resource=download\n",
    "\n",
    "> This data is sourced from the University of California Irvine's Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evalutation\n",
    "\n",
    "> The project will be pursued if a 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Dictionary\n",
    "a) Age: age of patient\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Sex: binary classification of male/female (0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Chest pain type: \n",
    "* 1: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart\n",
    "* 2: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart\n",
    "* 3: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)\n",
    "* 4: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease\n",
    "\n",
    "d) BP: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Cholesterol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "* serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides\n",
    "* above 200 is cause for concern\n",
    "\n",
    "f) FBS over 120: A test that measures blood sugar levels; elevated levels are associated with diabetes and insulin resistance, in which the body cannot properly handle sugar (binary classification, 0 or 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "g) EKG results: electrocardiographic results\n",
    "* 0: Nothing to note\n",
    "* 1: ST-T Wave abnormality\n",
    "    * can range from mild symptoms to severe problems\n",
    "* 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy \n",
    "    * Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber\n",
    "\n",
    "h) Max HR: maximum heart rate in bpm\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Exercise Angina: chest pain or discomfort caused when your heart muscle doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood (binary classification, 0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "j) ST Depression: ST segment depression may be determined by measuring the vertical distance between the patient's trace and the isoelectric line at a location 2-3 millimeters from the QRS complex. It is significant if it is more than 1 mm in V5-V6, or 1.5 mm in AVF or III\n",
    "\n",
    "k) Slope of ST:\n",
    "* 1: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)\n",
    "* 2: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)\n",
    "* 3: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart\n",
    "\n",
    "l) Number of vessels fluro: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
    "* colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through\n",
    "* the more blood movement the better (no clots)\n",
    "\n",
    "m) Thallium: thalium stress result\n",
    "* 1,3: normal\n",
    "* 6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now\n",
    "* 7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising\n",
    "\n",
    "n) Heart Disease: \"Presence\" or \"Absence\" "
